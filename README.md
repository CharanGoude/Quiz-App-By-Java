# Quiz-App-By-Java

📚 Online Quiz App – Console-Based Java Mini Project
This is a simple console-based quiz application built using Java. The app displays multiple-choice questions, accepts user answers, and calculates the score at the end.

💻 How It Works


The program uses a custom Question class to store each question, its options, and the correct answer.

A list of Question objects is created with sample questions.

Questions are displayed one by one on the console.

The user enters an answer (1-4) for each question.

The app checks the answer and updates the score.

At the end, the total score is displayed.
